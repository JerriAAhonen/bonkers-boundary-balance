Prototype game imitating the legendary Copter It

Controls:
- Tap and hold screen to ascend
- Release to descend

Implemented features in version 1.0 include:
- Full game loop with restart option at the end of the game
- Procedurally generated level with randomized obstacles and increasing movement speed (for now the seed for the level doesn't change)
- Highscore system storing up to 10 best scores
- Main menu where one can access volume settings and highscores

Future versions could implement:
- Different levels with different level generation settings
- Upgradable player character with new graphics and stats
- Possibility to submit a name when submitting a new highscore
- Always more eye candy
